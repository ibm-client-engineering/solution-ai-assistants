    :::note 
    The Genesys SDK does not work if launched from a local HTML file opened directly in your browser (using file://). It needs to be served from a server (which can be localhost) over HTTP. You can use [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) if you need a simple local server for testing purposes.

### 3. Using Genesys Live Agent
1. Log in to your Genesys trial account and toggle the **Off Queue** option in the top right to become **On Queue**.
2. Open your Watson Assistant that has been integrated with Genesys (over HTTP not on the UI or local HTML file) and follow action to connect to live agent.
3. Once you have clicked **Connect to Live Agent** go back to the Genesys account and you should see an incoming message which you can accept or decline. Click **Accept** and now you are able to communicate with a live customer using your Watson Assistant instance.
