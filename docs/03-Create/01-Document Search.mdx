Setting up document search requires three core components:
1) watsonx Discovery
2) watsonx.ai
3) watsonx Assistant

## Watson Discovery

### Enable Document search
To enable the document search capability, you'll need to configure Watsonx.ai and Watson Discovery to work with Watsonx Assistant through its actions.

##### Upload Actions:
1. On the Actions page of watsonx Assistant, click on Global Settings.
2. On the Upload/Download tab, click the Upload button and upload [this actions.json file](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/assistant-toolkit/blob/master/integrations/extensions/starter-kits/language-model-conversational-search/discovery-watsonx-actions.json) or the file that was given to you by your IBM instructors.
3. Configure the "Invoke watsonx generation API" action
   1. On Step 1, click "Edit extension" to setup watsonx.ai custom extension.
      ![](../../assets/screenshots/watsonx_assistant_watsonxai_action.png)
   2. For the Extension options, select "watsonx.ai" and for the Operation options, select "Generation"
   3. For "Parameters", configure the following to pass the these variables to the watsonx.ai custom extension properly.
      1. set **version** to `watsonx_api_version` variable
      2. set **input** to `model_input` variable
      3. set **model_id** to `model_id` variable
      4. set **project_id** to `watsonx_project_id` variable
         ![](../../assets/screenshots/watsonx_assistant_watsonxai_custom_extension_setup.png)
   4. Click "Apply", and click "Save".

##### Update session variables:

1. within the Actions page, navigate to "Actions / Variables / Created by you".
   ![](../../assets/screenshots/watsonx_assistant_variables.png)
1. Set `discovery_project_id` and `watsonx_project_id` session variable
   :::info
   **Where to get credentials**
   - **discovery_project_id**: within Watson Discovery: Upper left Hamburger icon -> Integrate and deploy -> API Information. Copy Project ID and navigate back to watsonx assistant to paste it in the `Initial value` box of this Session variable.
   - **watsonx_project_id**: - Go to [watsonx Platform](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/wx/home?context=wx) - If you do not have an project, create a new project. - **Check Services & integrations**: Within the project, navigate to Manage -> Services & Integrations. If no services is associated, click "Associate Service" -> select "Watson Machine Learning" -> click "Associate". - Once you confirm WML is associated, Navigate to Manage -> General -> Details -> Project ID. Copy Project ID and navigate back to watsonx assistant to paste it in the `Initial value` of this Session variable.
     :::
1. Once you've finished configuring the variables, click "Preview" on the lower right corner, and type in questions to test the Conversational Search in your assistant!
