## Overview
To successfully enable multilingual capabilities we leveraged an LLM via watsonx.ai. The translation process consisted of four steps:
1) User selects desired language: "English" or "Spanish"
2) If language is "Spanish", the user's query is translated to english.
3) Translated query is leverage for Document Search on english data corpus.
4) Answer from Document Search is translated back to spanish source language and surface to end user.

## How to Implement
:::note
    **Prerequisite Required:** [Document Search](/Create/solution-create-document%20search)
:::

#### **Modify watsonx Assistant actions:**
1.	Create assistant variable to store selected language by end user.
2.	Within the "Invoke watsonx generation API" which is configured [here](/Create/solution-create-document%20search#enable-document-search), create a watsonx.ai prompts for step 2 above.
3. Take translated output from watsonx.ai and pass as the context to carry out the Document search with watson discovery.
4. Within the "Invoke watsonx generation API" which is configured [here](/Create/solution-create-document%20search#enable-document-search), create a watsonx.ai prompts for step 4 above.
